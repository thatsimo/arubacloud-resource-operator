> **⚠️ Development Status**: This operator is currently under active development and is **not production-ready yet**. APIs and resource schemas may change. Use at your own risk in production environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- go version v1.24.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster

**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/aruba:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don’t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/aruba:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
> privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

> **NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall

**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/aruba:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/aruba/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v1-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
   can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.

## Helm

Helm charts provide an alternative deployment method using Kubernetes package management. This project includes automated Helm chart generation using [Helmify](https://github.com/arttor/helmify).

### What is Helm?

Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes that helps you manage Kubernetes applications. Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

### Generate Helm Charts

To generate Helm charts for this operator:

```sh
# Generate both CRD and operator charts
make helm-crd helm-operator
```

This creates two separate charts:

- **CRD Chart** (`config/charts/crd/`): Contains Custom Resource Definitions
- **Operator Chart** (`config/charts/operator/`): Contains the operator deployment

### Install using Helm

1. **Install CRDs first:**

```sh
helm install aruba-crd config/charts/crd/
```

2. **Install the operator:**

```sh
helm install aruba-operator config/charts/operator/ \
  --set image.repository=<your-registry>/aruba \
  --set image.tag=<your-tag>
```

### Test the Installation

Verify the installation:

```sh
# Check if CRDs are installed
kubectl get crd | grep arubacloud.com

# Check operator pod status
kubectl get pods -n aruba-operator-system

# Test with sample resources
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

### Uninstall

```sh
# Remove sample resources
kubectl delete -k config/samples/

# Remove operator
helm uninstall aruba-operator

# Remove CRDs
helm uninstall aruba-crd
```
